# Booking System - Phase 1: Penetration Test Report

## Test Objective
The objective of this test was to assess the security vulnerabilities in the registration page of the booking system (version 1 and version 2). The test aimed to identify common issues such as SQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities, authentication flaws, and improper data validation mechanisms.

## Test Methodology

### Tools Used:
- OWASP ZAP
- Manual Testing for business logic flaws and functional issues.

### Test Environment:
- Application URL: [http://localhost:8000/register](http://localhost:8000/register)
- Dockerized setup of the application as per instructions.
- ZAP was used for automated vulnerability scanning.
- Manual testing was conducted to verify vulnerabilities and perform checks on functionality.

## Test Results - Initial Version (Ver 1)

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
- **Issue:** Reflected XSS vulnerability was found on the registration page.
- **Location:** Name input field.
- **Description:** User input in the registration form was not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Fix Recommendation:** Implement input validation and output encoding for user input.

### 2. SQL Injection:
- **Issue:** SQL injection was detected in the registration form.
- **Location:** Username and password fields.
- **Description:** The application was vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user input in SQL queries.
- **Fix Recommendation:** Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

### 3. Missing CSRF Protection:
- **Issue:** No protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Location:** Registration form submission.
- **Description:** The application did not include anti-CSRF tokens, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
- **Fix Recommendation:** Implement CSRF tokens for sensitive forms.

### 4. Weak Password Storage:
- **Issue:** Passwords are stored in plain text.
- **Location:** Database.
- **Description:** The application does not hash passwords before storing them, risking user data exposure.
- **Fix Recommendation:** Use hashing algorithms like bcrypt to securely store passwords.
